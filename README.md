# Shape detection in a sequence of images#

SippyCup runs through a sequence of images and detect shapes "moving" across the view.
It distinguishes between circles and other shapes, and different sizes of circles.
The circles are labeled and counted.

Download and unzip raw_images.zip for a sample set of images.

Compile and run Sippycup.
